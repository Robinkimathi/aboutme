        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Information Technology at Zetech University and an online  cybersecurity bootcamp.
     <br>
            My passion lies in the field of cybersecurity specifically penetration testing , and my goal is to become an expert in both <br>
            penetration testing and a certified ethical hacker by the end. My interest in this field originated from watching many sci-fi movies with hacking stuffs <br>
             malware and also from youtube channels that teach cybersecuritynrelated stuff<br>
            </p>
              <p>A large majority of companies and government agencies hire  cybersecurity <br>
              experts to help strengthen networks, safeguard information, or prevent cyber-attacks. Thatâ€™s the <br>
              part that really interested me. With a large amount of unethical hacker groups out there, <br>
              there needs to be just as many ethical hackers that do good rather than bad. So this is what I want to do.<br></p>
              <p> I want to be the person to help prevent these attacks or even stop them and prevent any kind of data leakage or ransom.
            <br>In the campus, you'll find me studying hard, always striving to balance academic excellence with personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Join me on this journey as I share my experiences, childhood memories, educational achievements, <br>
            skills, and future aspirations.

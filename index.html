        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Information Technology at Zetech University. <br>
            My passion lies in the field of cybersecurity, and my goal is to become an expert in both <br>
            cybersecurity and web development by the end. The interest that I developed in this career<br>
             was due to a lot of what I’ve seen in the news over the years and from what I’ve personally<br>
              experienced over the years. </p>
              <p>A large majority of companies and government agencies hire these <br>
              experts to help strengthen networks, safeguard information, or prevent cyber-attacks. That’s the <br>
              part that really interested me. Cyber-attacks. With a large amount of hacker groups out there, <br>
              there needs to be just as many hackers that do good rather than bad. So this is what I want to do.<br></p>
              <p> I want to be the person to help prevent these attacks or even stop them. Cyber Security experts <br>
               as basically people who watch data logs..
            <br>In the campus, you'll find me studying hard, always striving to balance academic excellence with personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Join me on this journey as I share my experiences, childhood memories, educational achievements, <br>
            skills, and future aspirations.
